# Surface Pro Flicker Fix
A simple fix for screen flickering on the Surface Pro
## What does it do?
This program creates an icon on your taskbar. Every 0.2s it changes the icon to a SLIGHTY different color. This causes the screen to refresh and fixes the issue. The images included are for use on `KDE Plasma`. The gray color was taken from the taskbar.

This program was inspired by [THIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/t8ampp/surface_pro_screen_flicker_solver/) Reddit post.
